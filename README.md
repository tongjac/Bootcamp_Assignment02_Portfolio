# Responsive Portfolio

A responsive Portfolio built with Bootstrap and custom CSS. Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. I was asked to create a mobile-responsive design to a personal website.

## Using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following items:

- A navbar.

- A responsive layout.

- Responsive images.

## This Portfolio Website exhibits:

- A functional, deployed application.

- GitHub repository with a descriptive README.

- Consistent and functional Navbar on each page.

- Must use semantic html.

- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

- Contains your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

- Properly utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.
